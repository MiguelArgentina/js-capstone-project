## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.
- Internet browser compatible with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript ES6

## Getting Started

- Open your terminal - Windows: `Win + R`, then type `cmd` | Mac: `Command + space`, then type `Terminal`
- Navigate to a directory of your choosing using the `cd` command
- Run this command in your OS terminal: `git clone git@github.com:MiguelArgentina/js-capstone-project.git` to get a copy of the project.
- Navigate to the project's directory using the `cd` command

## Using the game

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory to install all dependencies. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080` by default).

## Testing

A script for testing was added, so the user can simply run npm test from within the project's folder to execute all the tests.
